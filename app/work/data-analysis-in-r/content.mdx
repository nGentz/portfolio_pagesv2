summary: "A comprehensive guide to statistical analysis and data visualization using R programming language."
---

A comprehensive project demonstrating advanced statistical analysis techniques using R programming language, covering everything from basic descriptive statistics to complex machine learning models.

## Project Scope

This project showcases the power of R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling. It serves as both a learning resource and a practical toolkit for data scientists and researchers.

## Analysis Components

```python
from PIL import Image
from torchvision import transforms
import torch

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224,224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),  # converts to (C,H,W) and scales to [0,1]
])

images = []
labels = []

for idx, row in avo_ripe_spreadsheet.iterrows():
    img_path = 'Hass Avocado Ripening Photographic Dataset/Avocado Ripening Dataset/' + row['File Name'] + '.jpg'
    img = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')  # ensure 3 channels
    img_tensor = transform(img)
    images.append(img_tensor)
    labels.append(row['Ripening Index Classification'])

X = torch.stack(images)  # shape: (N, C, H, W)
y = torch.tensor(labels)
```

### Descriptive Statistics
- Central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
- Dispersion metrics (variance, standard deviation, range)
- Distribution analysis and normality tests
- Correlation analysis between variables

### Inferential Statistics
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square)
- Confidence intervals and margin of error
- Power analysis for study design
- Multiple comparison corrections

### Regression Analysis
- Linear regression models
- Multiple regression with interaction terms
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes
- Model diagnostics and validation

## Data Visualization

### Base R Graphics
- Histograms and density plots
- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Box plots and violin plots
- Time series visualizations

### ggplot2 Enhancements
- Publication-quality graphics
- Faceted plots for subgroup analysis
- Custom themes and color schemes
- Interactive elements with plotly

## Advanced Techniques

### Machine Learning
- Random Forest classification
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering analysis (K-means, hierarchical)
- Principal Component Analysis

### Time Series Analysis
- Trend and seasonality decomposition
- ARIMA modeling
- Forecasting with confidence intervals
- Anomaly detection

## Code Structure

The project is organized into modular R scripts:
- `data_preparation.R`: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- `descriptive_analysis.R`: Basic statistical summaries
- `inferential_analysis.R`: Hypothesis testing
- `regression_models.R`: Predictive modeling
- `visualization.R`: Plot generation
- `report_generation.R`: Automated report creation

## Key Features
